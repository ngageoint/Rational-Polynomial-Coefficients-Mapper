# Rational-Polynomial-Coefficients-Mapper
C++ class that uses RPC coefficients to map an object's space coordinates represented in Latitude, Longitude, and Altitude to a sensor position represented in X,Y.

RPCs are used to help us understand where an object is within a plane when taking a picture. For example, the Washington Monument can be found in the image by what pixels you should look at if you want to see the Washington Monument in the image (pixel 506 in the x direction and 364 in the y direction).

The code is well documented both inline and in the documentation files in this repo.

## Origin
The RPC software was developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with Booz Allen.  The government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions. The software use, modification, and distribution rights are stipulated within the [MIT](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) license.
